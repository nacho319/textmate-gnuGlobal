This is a plugin for the [TextMate](http://github.com/textmate/) text editor
to do [GNUGlobal](https://www.gnu.org/software/global) code indexing and
searching across source code projects.  GNUGlobal can index
C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++/Java/YACC/PHP/Assembly, and isn't that hard to create new
language parsers.  Additionally, you can search definitions or declarations
separately.
